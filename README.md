# Data-Representation

This project includes two basic files:

- FruitMarket.html
- app.py

These two files represent the front-end web page and the REST API server, respectively.

While the server is running, web should be able to read JSON data and operate basic CRUD operations:

- Read all information
- Create new data
- Update existing data
- Delete exisitng data

Front-end site should be able to transform JSON to HTML and vice-versa for completing the above mentioned operations and to provide readable outputs through the website.

As of 06/01/2020, only basic operations have been achieved. Further developmnent is required in order to accomplish CRUD operations and to obtain a properly formatted output. Unfortunately, I was not able to get all pieces to fit in time.
